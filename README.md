# Community Cookbooks

Community Cookbooks is a website designed for users to store and share recipes with their friends and family. It uses a category system for recipes that includes appetizers, breakfast, dinner, and dessert recipes to make the recipes more organized. Along with this, the user can create, edit, delete, and share all their recipes.
The hosted website can be found at: https://community-cookbooks.herokuapp.com/
It used the Django framework for back-end support and utilizes the bootstrap library to help style the front-end.
